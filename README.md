# meet-n-music
VIA University College Android Development course project. 



## About the app
Meet 'n Music is an android app that is used to publish and share musical events: festivals, concerts, parties, etc. Users can search for events and notify to the event manager that they will assist. Each event shows its own information: description, images, weather, COVID restrictions, etc. 


## MoSCoW requirements
Our application will have some features with different crucial roles, so in order to have them structured we made a MoSCoW requirements.
- Meet n' Music is based on CRUD operations, so it **must have** :
    - A general home feed where the user can see scheduled events of its interest.
    - Detailed description for each event (Where, when, which music, etc).
    - COVID-19 prevention measures and restrictions.
    - A search bar where the user can find events either by name or genre.
    - All user settings and user profile features.
    - Log in and sign up options.
    - Creation event button for letting the user organize one.
    - Images inside event descriptions.
    - 'I will attend' button, in order to register the user to the event.
    - Editing and checking the already created event.

- Once we the 'must' requirements are done, our application will hard improve with some conditions that **should be** :
    - Feed organization based on location.
    - Correct use of an API for the temperature and weather conditions of an event.
    - Use of an other API for creating a map where the user can see its location and the events near him.

- For a high quality android app we **could apply** :
    - Q&A section below the event description.
    - A place where you can see the history and activity of your friends.

- We thought about this ideas, but we **won't have time** to implement them :
    - Notifications and alerts in the phone.
    - Changing the Q&A section for a real time chat.
